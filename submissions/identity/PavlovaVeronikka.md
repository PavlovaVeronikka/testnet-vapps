## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: SoulSync
- **Category**: identity

### Description
SoulSync is a decentralized identity management vApp that solves the problem of fragmented digital identities across multiple platforms. It allows users to create and manage a unified self-sovereign identity (SSI) that can be verified across different dApps and services without relying on centralized authorities.

### SL Integration  
SoulSync will use Soundness Layer for:
- Zero-knowledge proof generation for identity verification
- Secure key management and cryptographic operations
- Decentralized attestation and credential storage
- Cross-chain identity portability using SL's interoperability features

## Technical

### Architecture
Decentralized identity protocol with modular design:
- **Identity Core**: SSI management and cryptographic operations
- **Verification Engine**: ZK-proof generation and validation
- **Storage Layer**: Encrypted credential storage
- **Interoperability Module**: Cross-chain identity portability

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Wagmi
- **Backend**: Rust + Substrate SDK  
- **Blockchain**: SL + Polkadot parachain
- **Storage**: WALRUS + IPFS for encrypted storage

### Features
1. Self-sovereign identity creation and management
2. Zero-knowledge identity verification  
3. Cross-platform identity portability
4. Decentralized attestation system
5. Privacy-preserving credential sharing

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic identity creation and management
- [ ] SL integration for key management
